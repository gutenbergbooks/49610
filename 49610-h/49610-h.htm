at the left side of the room a pantry door. A
wood of oak, beech, hazel, and quicken is seen
through the window half hidden in vapour and
twilight. <span class="small">MAIRE</span> watches <span class="small">TEIG</span>, who fills a

<i>Interior of a coachbuilder’s workshop. Parts of a

a lion and unicorn. <span class="small">THOMAS</span> working at a

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I have prayed over Martin. I have prayed
a long time, but there is no move in him yet.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>You are giving yourself too much trouble,
Father. It’s as good for you to leave him alone
till the doctor’s bottle will come. If there is
any cure at all for what is on him, it is likely
the doctor will have it.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I think it is not doctor’s medicine will help
him in this case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>It will, it will. The doctor has his business
learned well. If Andrew had gone to him the
time I bade him and had not turned again to
bring yourself to the house, it is likely Martin
would be walking at this time. I am loth to
trouble you, Father, when the business is not
of your own sort. Any doctor at all should be
able and well able to cure the falling sickness.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>It is not any common sickness that is on him
now.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>I thought at the first it was gone to sleep he
was. But when shaking him and roaring at him
failed to rouse him, I knew well it was the falling
sickness. Believe me, the doctor will reach
it with his drugs.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Nothing but prayer can reach a soul that is
so far beyond the world as his soul is at this
moment.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>You are not saying that the life is gone out
of him!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>No, no, his life is in no danger. But where
he himself, the spirit, the soul, is gone, I cannot
say. It has gone beyond our imaginings.
He is fallen into a trance.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>He used to be queer as a child, going asleep
in the fields, and coming back with talk of
white horses he saw, and bright people like
angels or whatever they were. But I mended
that. I taught him to recognise stones beyond
angels with a few strokes of a rod. I would
never give in to visions or to trances.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>We who hold the faith have no right to
speak against trance or vision. Saint Elizabeth
had them, Saint Benedict, Saint Anthony, Saint
Columcille. Saint Catherine of Siena often lay
a long time as if dead.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>That might be so in the olden time, but those
things are gone out of the world now. Those
that do their work fair and honest have no
occasion to let the mind go rambling. What
would send my nephew, Martin Hearne, into
a trance, supposing trances to be in it, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
rubbing the gold on the lion and unicorn that
he had taken in hand to make a good job of for
the top of the coach?</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>taking up ornament</i>].</div>

<p>It is likely it was that sent him off. The
flashing of light upon it would be enough to
throw one that had a disposition to it into a
trance. There was a very saintly man, though
he was not of our church; he wrote a great book
called <i>Mysterium Magnum</i> was seven days in
a trance. Truth, or whatever truth he found,
fell upon him like a bursting shower, and he a
poor tradesman at his work. It was a ray of
sunlight on a pewter vessel that was the beginning
of all. [<i>Goes to the door and looks in.</i>]
There is no stir in him yet. It is either the
best thing or the worst thing can happen to
anyone, that is happening to him now.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>And what in the living world can happen to
a man that is asleep on his bed?</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>There are some would answer you that it is
to those who are awake that nothing happens,
and it is they that know nothing. He is gone
where all have gone for supreme truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.<br />
[<i>Sitting down again and taking up tools.</i>]</div>

<p>Well, maybe so. But work must go on and
coachbuilding must go on, and they will not
go on the time there is too much attention
given to dreams. A dream is a sort of a shadow,
no profit in it to anyone at all. A coach, now,
is a real thing and a thing that will last for
generations and be made use of to the last, and
maybe turn to be a hen-roost at its latter end.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I think Andrew told me it was a dream of
Martin’s that led to the making of that coach.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Well, I believe he saw gold in some dream,
and it led him to want to make some golden
thing, and coaches being the handiest, nothing
would do him till he put the most of his fortune
into the making of this golden coach. It turned
out better than I thought, for some of the
lawyers came looking at it at Assize time, and
through them it was heard of at Dublin Castle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and who now has it ordered but the Lord
Lieutenant! [<i><span class="small">FATHER JOHN</span> nods.</i>] Ready it
must be and sent off it must be by the end of
the month. It is likely King George will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
visiting Dublin, and it is he himself will be
sitting in it yet.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Martin has been working hard at it, I know.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>You never saw a man work the way he did,
day and night, near ever since the time six
months ago he first came home from France.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I never thought he would be so good at a
trade. I thought his mind was only set on books.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>He should be thankful to myself for that.
Any person I will take in hand, I make a clean
job of them the same as I would make of any
other thing in my yard—coach, half-coach,
hackney-coach, ass-car, common-car, post-chaise,
calash, chariot on two wheels, on four
wheels. Each one has the shape Thomas Hearne
put on it, and it in his hands; and what I can
do with wood and iron, why would I not be
able to do it with flesh and blood, and it in a
way my own?</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Indeed, I know you did your best for Martin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Every best. Checked him, taught him the
trade, sent him to the monastery in France for
to learn the language and to see the wide world;
but who should know that if you did not know
it, Father John, and I doing it according to
your own advice?</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I thought his nature needed spiritual guidance
and teaching, the best that could be found.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>I thought myself it was best for him to be
away for a while. There are too many wild lads
about this place. He to have stopped here, he
might have taken some fancies, and got into
some trouble, going against the Government
maybe the same as Johnny Gibbons that is at this
time an outlaw, having a price upon his head.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>That is so. That imagination of his might
have taken fire here at home. It was better
putting him with the Brothers, to turn it to
imaginings of heaven.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Well, I will soon have a good hardy tradesman
made of him now that will live quiet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
rear a family, and be maybe appointed coachbuilder
to the Royal Family at the last.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>at window</i>].</div>

<p>I see your brother Andrew coming back from
the doctor; he is stopping to talk with a troop
of beggars that are sitting by the side of the road.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>There, now, is another that I have shaped.
Andrew used to be a bit wild in his talk and
in his ways, wanting to go rambling, not content
to settle in the place where he was reared.
But I kept a guard over him; I watched the
time poverty gave him a nip, and then I settled
him into the business. He never was so good
a worker as Martin, he is too fond of wasting
his time talking vanities. But he is middling
handy, and he is always steady and civil to customers.
I have no complaint worth while to be
making this last twenty years against Andrew.</p>

<div class="enter">[<i><span class="small">ANDREW</span> comes in.</i>]</div>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>Beggars there outside going the road to the
Kinvara fair. They were saying there is news
that Johnny Gibbons is coming back from
France on the quiet; the king’s soldiers are
watching the ports for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Let you keep now, Andrew, to the business
you have in hand. Will the doctor be coming
himself or did he send a bottle that will cure
Martin?</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>The doctor can’t come, for he’s down with
the lumbago in the back. He questioned me
as to what ailed Martin, and he got a book to
go looking for a cure, and he began telling me
things out of it, but I said I could not be
carrying things of that sort in my head. He
gave me the book then, and he has marks put
in it for the places where the cures are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
wait now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [<i>Reads</i>] ‘Compound medicines
are usually taken inwardly, or outwardly applied;
inwardly taken, they should be either
liquid or solid; outwardly, they should be fomentations
or sponges wet in some decoctions.’</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>He had a right to have written it out himself
upon a paper. Where is the use of all
that?</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>I think I moved the mark maybe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here,
now, is the part he was reading to me himself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
‘The remedies for diseases belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the skins next the brain, headache, vertigo,
cramp, convulsions, palsy, incubus, apoplexy,
falling sickness.’</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>It is what I bid you to tell him that it was
the falling sickness.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW [<i>dropping book</i>].</div>

<p>O, my dear, look at all the marks gone out
of it! Wait, now, I partly remember what he
said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a blister he spoke of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or to be
smelling hartshorn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or the sneezing powder .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
or if all fails, to try letting the blood.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>All this has nothing to do with the real case.
It is all waste of time.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>That is what I was thinking myself, Father.
Sure it was I was the first to call out to you when
I saw you coming down from the hill-side, and
to bring you in to see what could you do. I
would have more trust in your means than in
any doctor’s learning. And in case you might
fail to cure him, I have a cure myself I heard
from my grandmother—God rest her soul!—and
she told me she never knew it to fail. A
person to have the falling sickness, to cut the
top of his nails and a small share of the hair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
his head, and to put it down on the floor, and
to take a harry-pin and drive it down with
that into the floor and to leave it there. ‘That
is the cure will never fail,’ she said, ‘to rise up
any person at all having the falling sickness.’</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>hand on ear</i>].</div>

<p>I will go back to the hill-side, I will go back
to the hill-side; but no, no, I must do what I
can. I will go again, I will wrestle, I will
strive my best to call him back with prayer.</p>

<div class="right">[<i>Goes in and shuts door.</i></div>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>It is queer Father John is sometimes, and
very queer. There are times when you would
say that he believes in nothing at all.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>If you wanted a priest, why did you not get
our own parish priest that is a sensible man,
and a man that you would know what his
thoughts are? You know well the bishop
should have something against Father John to
have left him through the years in that poor
mountainy place, minding the few unfortunate
people that were left out of the last famine.
A man of his learning to be going in rags the
way he is, there must be some good cause for
that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>I had all that in mind and I bringing him.
But I thought he would have done more for
Martin than what he is doing. To read a
Mass over him I thought he would, and to be
convulsed in the reading it, and some strange
thing to have gone out with a great noise
through the doorway.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>It would give no good name to the place
such a thing to be happening in it. It is well
enough for labouring-men and for half-acre
men. It would be no credit at all such a thing
to be heard of in this house, that is for coachbuilding
the capital of the county.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>If it is from the devil this sickness comes, it
would be best to put it out whatever way it
would be put out. But there might no bad thing
be on the lad at all. It is likely he was with
wild companions abroad, and that knocking
about might have shaken his health. I was
that way myself one time.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Father John said that it was some sort of a
vision or a trance, but I would give no heed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to what he would say. It is his trade to see
more than other people would see, the same
as I myself might be seeing a split in a leather
car hood that no other person would find out
at all.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>If it is the falling sickness is on him, I have
no objection to that—a plain, straight sickness
that was cast as a punishment on the unbelieving
Jews. It is a thing that might attack one
of a family, and one of another family, and not
to come upon their kindred at all. A person
to have it, all you have to do is not to go between
him and the wind, or fire, or water. But
I am in dread trance is a thing might run
through the house the same as the cholera
morbus.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>In my belief there is no such thing as a
trance. Letting on people do be to make the
world wonder the time they think well to rise
up. To keep them to their work is best, and
not to pay much attention to them at all.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>I would not like trances to be coming on
myself. I leave it in my will if I die without
cause, a holly-stake to be run through my heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the way I will lie easy after burial, and not
turn my face downwards in my coffin. I tell
you I leave it on you in my will.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Leave thinking of your own comforts,
Andrew, and give your mind to the business.
Did the smith put the irons yet on to the shafts
of this coach?</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>I will go see did he.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Do so, and see did he make a good job of
it. Let the shafts be sound and solid if they
are to be studded with gold.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>They are, and the steps along with them—glass
sides for the people to be looking in at
the grandeur of the satin within—the lion
and the unicorn crowning all. It was a great
thought Martin had the time he thought of
making this coach!</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>It is best for me to go see the smith myself
and leave it to no other one. You can be
attending to that ass-car out in the yard wants a
new tyre in the wheel—out in the rear of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
yard it is. [<i>They go to door.</i>] To pay attention
to every small thing, and to fill up every
minute of time shaping whatever you have to
do, that is the way to build up a business.</p>

<div class="right">[<i>They go out.</i></div>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>bringing in <span class="small">MARTIN</span></i>].</div>

<p>They are gone out now—the air is fresher
here in the workshop—you can sit here for a
while. You are now fully awake, you have
been in some sort of a trance or a sleep.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Who was it that pulled at me? Who
brought me back?</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>It is I, Father John, did it. I prayed a long
time over you and brought you back.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>You, Father John, to be so unkind! O leave
me, leave me alone!</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>You are in your dream still.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>It was no dream, it was real. Do you not
smell the broken fruit—the grapes? the room
is full of the smell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Tell me what you have seen, where you
have been?</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>There were horses—white horses rushing
by, with white shining riders—there was a
horse without a rider, and someone caught me
up and put me upon him and we rode away,
with the wind, like the wind—</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>That is a common imagining. I know many
poor persons have seen that.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>We went on, on, on. We came to a sweet-smelling
garden with a gate to it, and there
were wheatfields in full ear around, and there
were vineyards like I saw in France, and the
grapes in bunches. I thought it to be one of
the townlands of heaven. Then I saw the
horses we were on had changed to unicorns, and
they began trampling the grapes and breaking
them. I tried to stop them but I could not.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>That is strange, that is strange. What is it
that brings to mind? I heard it in some place,
<i>monoceros de astris</i>, the unicorn from the stars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>They tore down the wheat and trampled it on
stones, and then they tore down what were left
of grapes and crushed and bruised and trampled
them. I smelt the wine, it was flowing on
every side—then everything grew vague. I
cannot remember clearly, everything was silent;
the trampling now stopped, we were all waiting
for some command. Oh! was it given!
I was trying to hear it; there was someone
dragging, dragging me away from that. I am
sure there was a command given, and there
was a great burst of laughter. What was it?
What was the command? Everything seemed
to tremble round me.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Did you awake then?</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I do not think I did, it all changed—it was
terrible, wonderful! I saw the unicorns trampling,
trampling, but not in the wine troughs.
Oh, I forget! Why did you waken me?</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I did not touch you. Who knows what
hands pulled you away? I prayed, that was all
I did. I prayed very hard that you might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
awake. If I had not, you might have died. I
wonder what it all meant? The unicorns—what
did the French monk tell me?—strength
they meant, virginal strength, a rushing, lasting,
tireless strength.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>They were strong. Oh, they made a great
noise with their trampling.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>And the grapes, what did they mean? It puts
me in mind of the psalm, <i>Et calix meus inebrians
quam præclarus est</i>. It was a strange vision, a
very strange vision, a very strange vision.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>How can I get back to that place?</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>You must not go back, you must not think
of doing that. That life of vision, of contemplation,
is a terrible life, for it has far more of
temptation in it than the common life. Perhaps
it would have been best for you to stay under
rules in the monastery.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I could not see anything so clearly there.
It is back here in my own place the visions
come, in the place where shining people used
to laugh around me, and I a little lad in a bib.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>You cannot know but it was from the Prince
of this world the vision came. How can one ever
know unless one follows the discipline of the
Church? Some spiritual director, some wise
learned man, that is what you want. I do not
know enough. What am I but a poor banished
priest, with my learning forgotten, my books
never handled and spotted with the damp!</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I will go out into the fields where you cannot
come to me to awake me. I will see that townland
again; I will hear that command. I cannot
wait, I must know what happened, I must
bring that command to mind again.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.<br />
[<i>Putting himself between <span class="small">MARTIN</span> and the door.</i>]</div>

<p>You must have patience as the saints had it.
You are taking your own way. If there is a
command from God for you, you must wait
His good time to receive it.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Must I live here forty years, fifty years .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

common things, doing work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some foolish

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Here they are coming; it is time for me to
go. I must think and I must pray. My mind
is troubled about you. [<i>To <span class="small">THOMAS</span> as he and
<span class="small">ANDREW</span> come in.</i>] Here he is; be very kind to
him for he has still the weakness of a little
child.</p>
<div class="right">[<i>Goes out.</i></div>
<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Are you well of the fit, lad?</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>It was no fit. I was away—for awhile—no,
you will not believe me if I tell you.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>I would believe it, Martin. I used to have
very long sleeps myself and very queer dreams.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>You had, till I cured you, taking you in
hand and binding you to the hours of the clock.
The cure that will cure yourself, Martin, and
will waken you, is to put the whole of your
mind on to your golden coach; to take it in
hand and to finish it out of face.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Not just now. I want to think—to try and
remember what I saw, something that I heard,
that I was told to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>No, but put it out of your mind. There is no
man doing business that can keep two things in
his head. A Sunday or a holy-day, now, you
might go see a good hurling or a thing of the
kind, but to be spreading out your mind on
anything outside of the workshop on common
days, all coachbuilding would come to an end.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I don’t think it is building I want to do. I
don’t think that is what was in the command.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>It is too late to be saying that, the time you
have put the most of your fortune in the business.
Set yourself now to finish your job, and
when it is ended maybe I won’t begrudge you
going with the coach as far as Dublin.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>That is it, that will satisfy him. I had a
great desire myself, and I young, to go travelling
the roads as far as Dublin. The roads are
the great things, they never come to an end.
They are the same as the serpent having his
tail swallowed in his own mouth.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>It was not wandering I was called to. What
was it? what was it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>What you are called to, and what everyone
having no great estate is called to, is to work.
Sure the world itself could not go on without
work.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I wonder if that is the great thing, to make
the world go on? No, I don’t think that is
the great thing—what does the Munster poet
call it?—‘this crowded slippery coach-loving
world.’ I don’t think I was told to work for that.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>I often thought that myself. It is a pity the
stock of the Hearnes to be asked to do any
work at all.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Rouse yourself, Martin, and don’t be talking
the way a fool talks. You started making that
golden coach, and you were set upon it, and
you had me tormented about it. You have
yourself wore out working at it, and planning it,
and thinking of it, and at the end of the race,
when you have the winning-post in sight, and
horses hired for to bring it to Dublin Castle,
you go falling into sleeps and blathering about
dreams, and we run to a great danger of letting
the profit and the sale go by. Sit down on the
bench now, and lay your hands to the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN [<i>sitting down</i>].</div>

<p>I will try. I wonder why I ever wanted to
make it; it was no good dream set me doing
that. [<i>He takes up wheel.</i>] What is there in a
wooden wheel to take pleasure in it? Gilding
it outside makes it no different.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>That is right, now. You had some good
plan for making the axle run smooth.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.<br />
[<i>Letting wheel fall and putting his hands to his head.</i>]</div>

<p>It is no use. [<i>Angrily.</i>] Why did you send
the priest to awake me? My soul is my own
and my mind is my own. I will send them to
where I like. You have no authority over my
thoughts.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>That is no way to be speaking to me. I am
head of this business. Nephew, or no nephew,
I will have no one come cold or unwilling to
the work.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I had better go; I am of no use to you. I
am going—I must be alone—I will forget if I
am not alone. Give me what is left of my
money and I will go out of this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.<br />
[<i>Opening a press and taking out a bag and
throwing it to him.</i>]</div>

<p>There is what is left of your money! The
rest of it you have spent on the coach. If you
want to go, go, and I will not have to be
annoyed with you from this out.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>Come now with me, Thomas. The boy
is foolish, but it will soon pass over. He has
not my sense to be giving attention to what
you will say. Come along now, leave him for
awhile; leave him to me I say, it is I will get
inside his mind.</p>

<div class="hang2">[<i>He leads <span class="small">THOMAS</span> out. <span class="small">MARTIN</span> bangs door

<p>O, but wait. I understand you. Thomas

them. Wasn’t I telling you I was just
like you once?</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Like me? Did you ever see the other things,
the things beyond?</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>I did. It is not the four walls of the house
keep me content. Thomas doesn’t know. Oh,
no, he doesn’t know.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>No, he has no vision.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>He has not, nor any sort of a heart for a
frolic.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>He has never heard the laughter and the
music beyond.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>He has not, nor the music of my own little
flute. I have it hidden in the thatch outside.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Does the body slip from you as it does from
me? They have not shut your window into
eternity?</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>Thomas never shut a window I could not
get through. I knew you were one of my own
sort. When I am sluggish in the morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Thomas says, ‘Poor Andrew is getting old.’
That is all he knows. The way to keep young
is to do the things youngsters do. Twenty
years I have been slipping away, and he never
found me out yet!</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>That is what they call ecstasy, but there is
no word that can tell out very plain what it
means. That freeing of the mind from its
thoughts, those wonders we know when we
put them into words; the words seem as little
like them as blackberries are like the moon and
sun.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>I found that myself the time they knew me
to be wild, and used to be asking me to say
what pleasure did I find in cards, and women,
and drink.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>You might help me to remember that vision
I had this morning, to understand it. The
memory of it has slipped from me. Wait, it
is coming back, little by little. I know that I
saw the unicorns trampling, and then a figure,
a many-changing figure, holding some bright
thing. I knew something was going to happen
or to be said, something that would make my
whole life strong and beautiful like the rushing
of the unicorns, and then, and then—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>How could I forget it or mistake it? It has
all come upon me now; the reasons of it all,
like a flood, like a flooded river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY [<i>weeping</i>].</div>

<p>It was the hunger brought me in and the
drouth.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Were you given any other message? Did
you see the unicorns?</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>I saw nothing and heard nothing; near dead
I am with the fright I got and with the hardship
of the gaol.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>To destroy, to overthrow all that comes between
us and God, between us and that shining
country. To break the wall, Andrew, to break
the thing—whatever it is that comes between,
but where to begin—</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>What is it you are talking about?</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>It may be that this man is the beginning.
He has been sent—the poor, they have nothing,
and so they can see heaven as we cannot. He
and his comrades will understand me. But how
to give all men high hearts that they may all
understand?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>It’s the juice of the grey barley will do that.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>To rise everybody’s heart, is it? Is it that
was your meaning all the time? If you will
take the blame of it all, I’ll do what you want.
Give me the bag of money then. [<i>He takes it up.</i>]
O, I’ve a heart like your own. I’ll lift the world,
too. The people will be running from all parts.
O, it will be a great day in this district.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>Will I go with you?</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>No, you must stay here; we have things to
do and to plan.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>Destroyed we all are with the hunger and
the drouth.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Go, then, get food and drink, whatever is
wanted to give you strength and courage. Gather
your people together here, bring them all in.
We have a great thing to do. I have to begin—I
want to tell it to the whole world. Bring them
in, bring them in, I will make the house ready.</p>

<h3>ACT II</h3>


<div class="hang1"><i>The same workshop. <span class="small">MARTIN</span> seen arranging mugs
and bread, etc., on a table. <span class="small">FATHER JOHN</span> comes
in, knocking at open door as he comes; his mind
intensely absorbed.</i></div>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Come in, come in, I have got the house ready.
Here is bread and meat—everybody is welcome.</p>

<div class="right">[<i>Hearing no answer, turns round.</i></div>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Martin, I have come back. There is something
I want to say to you.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>You are welcome, there are others coming.
They are not of your sort, but all are welcome.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I have remembered suddenly something that
I read when I was in the seminary.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>You seem very tired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>sitting down</i>].</div>

<p>I had almost got back to my own place
when I thought of it. I have run part of the
way. It is very important; it is about the trance
that you have been in. When one is inspired
from above, either in trance or in contemplation,
one remembers afterwards all that one has
seen and read. I think there must be something
about it in St. Thomas. I know that I
have read a long passage about it years ago. But,
Martin, there is another kind of inspiration, or
rather an obsession or possession. A diabolical
power comes into one’s body, or overshadows
it. Those whose bodies are taken hold of in this
way, jugglers, and witches, and the like, can
often tell what is happening in distant places,
or what is going to happen, but when they
come out of that state they remember nothing.
I think you said—</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>That I could not remember.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>You remembered something, but not all.
Nature is a great sleep; there are dangerous
and evil spirits in her dreams, but God is above
Nature. She is a darkness, but He makes
everything clear; He is light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>All is clear now. I remember all, or all that
matters to me. A poor man brought me a
word, and I know what I have to do.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Ah, I understand, words were put into his
mouth. I have read of such things. God
sometimes uses some common man as his messenger.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>You may have passed the man who brought
it on the road. He left me but now.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Very likely, very likely, that is the way it
happened. Some plain, unnoticed man has
sometimes been sent with a command.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I saw the unicorns trampling in my dream.
They were breaking the world. I am to destroy,
destruction was the word the messenger spoke.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>To destroy?</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>To bring again the old disturbed exalted life,
the old splendour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>You are not the first that dream has come to.
[<i>Gets up, and walks up and down.</i>] It has been
wandering here and there, calling now to this
man, now to that other. It is a terrible dream.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Father John, you have had the same thought.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Men were holy then, there were saints everywhere.
There was reverence; but now it is all
work, business, how to live a long time. Ah, if
one could change it all in a minute, even by
war and violence! There is a cell where Saint
Ciaran used to pray; if one could bring that
time again!</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Do not deceive me. You have had the
command.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Why are you questioning me? You are
asking me things that I have told to no one
but my confessor.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>We must gather the crowds together, you
and I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I have dreamed your dream, it was long ago.
I had your vision.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>And what happened?</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>harshly</i>].</div>

<p>It was stopped; that was an end. I was sent
to the lonely parish where I am, where there
was no one I could lead astray. They have
left me there. We must have patience; the
world was destroyed by water, it has yet to be
consumed by fire.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Why should we be patient? To live seventy
years, and others to come after us and live
seventy years it may be; and so from age to
age, and all the while the old splendour dying
more and more.</p>

<div class="hang2">[<i>A noise of shouting. <span class="small">ANDREW</span>, who has been
standing at the door, comes in.</i></div>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>Martin says truth, and he says it well.
Planing the side of a cart or a shaft, is that
life? It is not. Sitting at a desk writing
letters to the man that wants a coach, or to
the man that won’t pay for the one he has got,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
is that life, I ask you? Thomas arguing at
you and putting you down—‘Andrew, dear
Andrew, did you put the tyre on that wheel
yet?’ Is that life? Not, it is not. I ask you
all, what do you remember when you are dead?
It’s the sweet cup in the corner of the widow’s
drinking-house that you remember. Ha, ha,
listen to that shouting! That is what the lads
in the village will remember to the last day
they live.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Why are they shouting? What have you
told them?</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>Never you mind; you left that to me. You
bade me to lift their hearts and I did lift them.
There is not one among them but will have
his head like a blazing tar-barrel before morning.
What did your friend the beggar say?
The juice of the grey barley, he said.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>You accursed villain! You have made them
drunk!</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>Not at all, but lifting them to the stars.
That is what Martin bade me to do, and there
is no one can say I did not do it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<div class="hang2">[<i>A shout at door, and beggars push in a barrel.

<p>Drive them out of your uncle’s house!</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Come, Father, it is better for you to go.
Go back to your own place. I have taken the
command. It is better perhaps for you that
you did not take it.</p>

<div class="right">[<i><span class="small">FATHER JOHN</span> and <span class="small">MARTIN</span> go out.</i></div>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>It is well for that old lad he didn’t come
between ourselves and our luck. Himself to
be after his meal, and ourselves staggering with
the hunger! It would be right to have flayed
him and to have made bags of his skin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>What a hurry you are in to get your enough!

pot-picker, you!</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>That you may be put up to-morrow to take
the place of that decent son of yours that had
the yard of the gaol wore with walking it till

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>If he had, he had a mother to come to, and
he would know her when he did see her; and
that is what no son of your own could do and
he to meet you at the foot of the gallows.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>If I did know you, I knew too much of you
since the first beginning of my life! What
reward did I ever get travelling with you?
What store did you give me of cattle or of
goods? What provision did I get from you
by day or by night but your own bad character
to be joined on to my own, and I following at
your heels, and your bags tied round about me!</p>

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>Disgrace and torment on you! Whatever
you got from me, it was more than any reward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>

or any honourable thing at all, but only the
hurt and the harm of the world and its shame!</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>What would he give you, and you going
with him without leave! Crooked and foolish
you were always, and you begging by the side
of the ditch.</p>

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>Begging or sharing, the curse of my heart
upon you! It’s better off I was before ever I

you were not hardened as you are!</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>Some decent lad, I suppose, with a good way
of living and a mind to send up his name upon
the roads.</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>You that have been gaoled this eight months
know little of this countryside. It isn’t a limping
stroller like yourself the Boys would let
come among them. But I know. I went to
the drill a few nights and I skinning kids for
the mountainy men. In a quarry beyond the
drill is—they have their plans made—it’s the
square house of the Brownes is to be made an
attack on and plundered. Do you know, now,
who is the leader they are waiting for?</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>How would I know that?</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY [<i>standing up excitedly</i>].</div>

<p>Sure that man could not be Johnny Gibbons
that is outlawed!</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>I asked news of him from the old lad, and I
bringing in the drink along with him. ‘Don’t
be asking questions,’ says he; ‘take the treat he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
gives you,’ says he. ‘If a lad that has a high
heart has a mind to rouse the neighbours,’ says
he, ‘and to stretch out his hand to all that pass
the road, it is in France he learned it,’ says he,
‘the place he is but lately come from, and where
the wine does be standing open in tubs. Take
your treat when you get it,’ says he, ‘and make
no delay or all might be discovered and put an
end to.’</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>He came over the sea from France! It is
Johnny Gibbons, surely, but it seems to me they
were calling him by some other name.</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>A man on his keeping might go by a hundred
names. Would he be telling it out to us that
he never saw before, and we with that clutch

<p>That sounds to be a queer name of an army.
Ribbons I can understand, Whiteboys, Rightboys,
Threshers, and Peep o’ Day, but Unicorns
I never heard of before.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>It is not a queer name but a very good name.
[<i>Takes up lion and unicorn.</i>] It is often you saw
that before you in the dock. There is the unicorn
with the one horn, and what it is he is
going against? The lion of course. When he
has the lion destroyed, the crown must fall and
be shivered. Can’t you see it is the League of
the Unicorns is the league that will fight and
destroy the power of England and King George?</p>

we’ll be attacking the Square House! Arms
there are in it, riches that would smother the

shod with no less than silver!</p>

Has anything more come to you? You have

hear anything that is beyond the world?</p>

<p>I do not. I have nothing at all to do with
Freemasons or witchcraft.</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>What is it? What is it I have to do?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>I see a great smoke, I see burning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there
is a great smoke overhead.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>That means we have to burn away a great
deal that men have piled up upon the earth.
We must bring men once more to the wildness
of the clean green earth.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>Herbs for my healing, the big herb and the
little herb, it is true enough they get their great
strength out of the earth.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>Who was it the green sod of Ireland belonged
to in the olden times? Wasn’t it to the ancient
race it belonged? And who has possession of
it now but the race that came robbing over the
sea? The meaning of that is to destroy the big
houses and the towns, and the fields to be given
back to the ancient race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>That is it. You don’t put it as I do, but
what matter? Battle is all.</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>Columcille said, the four corners to be burned,
and then the middle of the field to be burned.
I tell you it was Columcille’s prophecy said that.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>Iron handcuffs I see and a rope and a gallows,
and it maybe is not for yourself I see it, but
for some I have acquaintance with a good way
back.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>That means the law. We must destroy the
law. That was the first sin, the first mouthful
of the apple.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>So it was, so it was. The law is the worst
loss. The ancient law was for the benefit of all.
It is the law of the English is the only sin.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>When there were no laws men warred on
one another and man to man, not with machines
made in towns as they do now, and they grew
hard and strong in body. They were altogether
alive like him that made them in his image,
like people in that unfallen country. But presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
they thought it better to be safe, as if
safety mattered or anything but the exaltation
of the heart, and to have eyes that danger had
made grave and piercing. We must overthrow
the laws and banish them.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>It is what I say, to put out the laws is to put
out the whole nation of the English. Laws for
themselves they made for their own profit, and
left us nothing at all, no more than a dog or a
sow.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>An old priest I see, and I would not say is
he the one was here or another. Vexed and
troubled he is, kneeling fretting and ever-fretting
in some lonesome ruined place.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I thought it would come to that. Yes, the
Church too—that is to be destroyed. Once
men fought with their desires and their fears,
with all that they call their sins, unhelped, and
their souls became hard and strong. When we
have brought back the clean earth and destroyed
the law and the Church all life will become
like a flame of fire, like a burning eye .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh,
how to find words for it all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all that is not
life will pass away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>It is Luther’s Church he means, and the
humpbacked discourse of Seaghan Calvin’s
Bible. So we will break it, and make an end of it.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>We will go out against the world and break
it and unmake it. [<i>Rising.</i>] We are the army
of the Unicorn from the Stars! We will trample
it to pieces.—We will consume the world, we
will burn it away—Father John said the world

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Come with me, Martin. There is terrible
work going on in the town! There is mischief
gone abroad. Very strange things are happening!</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>What are you talking of? What has happened?</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Come along, I say, it must be put a stop to.

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I wonder how that has happened. Can it
have anything to do with Andrew’s plan?</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>Are you giving no heed to what I’m saying?
There is not a man, I tell you, in the parish and
beyond the parish but has left the work he
was doing whether in the field or in the mill.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Then all work has come to an end? Perhaps
that was a good thought of Andrew’s.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>There is not a man has come to sensible
years that is not drunk or drinking! My own
labourers and my own serving-men are sitting
on counters and on barrels! I give you my
word, the smell of the spirits and the porter
and the shouting and the cheering within, made
the hair to rise up on my scalp.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>And yet there is not one of them that does
not feel that he could bridle the four winds.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS [<i>sitting down in despair</i>].</div>

<p>You are drunk too. I never thought you had
a fancy for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>It is hard for you to understand. You have
worked all your life. You have said to yourself
every morning, ‘What is to be done to-day?’
and when you are tired out you have thought
of the next day’s work. If you gave yourself
an hour’s idleness, it was but that you might
work the better. Yet it is only when one has
put work away that one begins to live.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>It is those French wines that did it.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I have been beyond the earth. In Paradise,
in that happy townland, I have seen the shining
people. They were all doing one thing or another,
but not one of them was at work. All
that they did was but the overflowing of their
idleness, and their days were a dance bred of
the secret frenzy of their hearts, or a battle
where the sword made a sound that was like
laughter.</p>

<div class="speakerc">THOMAS.</div>

<p>You went away sober from out of my hands;
they had a right to have minded you better.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>No man can be alive, and what is paradise
but fulness of life, if whatever he sets his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to in the daylight cannot carry him from exaltation
to exaltation, and if he does not rise into
the frenzy of contemplation in the night silence.
Events that are not begotten in joy are misbegotten
and darken the world, and nothing
is begotten in joy if the joy of a thousand years
has not been crushed into a moment.</p>

me to be regular and to be working and to be
going through the day and the night without
company and to be thinking of nothing but the
trade? What did I want with a trade? I got
a sight of the fairy gold one time in the mountains.
I would have found it again and brought
riches from it but for you keeping me so close
to the work.</p>

<div class="hang1">
<i>Before dawn. A wild rocky place, <span class="small">NANNY</span> and
<span class="small">BIDDY LALLY</span> squatting by a fire. Rich stuffs, etc.,
strewn about. <span class="small">PAUDEEN</span> watching by <span class="small">MARTIN</span>,

<div class="speakerc">NANNY [<i>to <span class="small">PAUDEEN</span></i>].</div>

<p>Well, you are great heroes and great warriors
and great lads altogether, to have put down the
Brownes the way you did, yourselves and the
Whiteboys of the quarry. To have ransacked
the house and have plundered it! Look at the
silks and the satins and the grandeurs I brought
away! Look at that now! [<i>Holds up a velvet
cloak.</i>] It’s a good little jacket for myself will
come out of it. It’s the singers will be stopping
their songs and the jobbers turning from their
cattle in the fairs to be taking a view of the
laces of it and the buttons! It’s my far-off
cousins will be drawing from far and near!</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>There was not so much gold in it all as what
they were saying there was. Or maybe that
fleet of Whiteboys had the place ransacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
before we ourselves came in. Bad cess to them
that put it in my mind to go gather up the full
of my bag of horseshoes out of the forge. Silver
they were saying they were, pure white silver;
and what are they in the end but only hardened
iron! A bad end to them! [<i>Flings away horseshoes.</i>]
The time I will go robbing big houses
again it will not be in the light of the full moon
I will go doing it, that does be causing every
common thing to shine out as if for a deceit
and a mockery. It’s not shining at all they are
at this time, but duck yellow and dark.</p>

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>To leave the big house blazing after us, it was
that crowned all! Two houses to be burned to
ashes in the one night. It is likely the servant-girls
were rising from the feathers and the cocks
crowing from the rafters for seven miles around,
taking the flames to be the whitening of the
dawn.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>It is the lad is stretched beyond you have to
be thankful to for that. There was never seen
a leader was his equal for spirit and for daring.
Making a great scatter of the guards the way
he did. Running up roofs and ladders, the fire
in his hand, till you’d think he would be apt to
strike his head against the stars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>I partly guessed death was near him, and the
queer shining look he had in his two eyes, and
he throwing sparks east and west through the
beams. I wonder now was it some inward wound
he got, or did some hardy lad of the Brownes
give him a tip on the skull unknownst in the
fight? It was I myself found him, and the troop
of the Whiteboys gone, and he lying by the
side of a wall as weak as if he had knocked a
mountain. I failed to waken him trying him
with the sharpness of my nails, and his head fell
back when I moved it, and I knew him to be
spent and gone.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>It’s a pity you not to have left him where he
was lying and said no word at all to Paudeen or
to that son you have, that kept us back from
following on, bringing him here to this shelter
on sacks and upon poles.</p>

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>What way could I help letting a screech out
of myself, and the life but just gone out of him
in the darkness, and not a living Christian by
his side but myself and the great God?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>It’s on ourselves the vengeance of the red
soldiers will fall, they to find us sitting here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
same as hares in a tuft. It would be best for us
follow after the rest of the army of the Whiteboys.</p>

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>Whisht! I tell you. The lads are cracked
about him. To get but the wind of the word of
leaving him, it’s little but they’d knock the
head off the two of us. Whisht!</p>

baked in the night-time, the horses are not fed
in the stalls, the cows are not milked in the

us all, and you to be cut down in your prime.

time I sent for yourself to send the little lad of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a messenger looking for a priest to overtake him.
It might be in the end the Almighty is the best
man for us all!</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>Sure I sent him on myself to bid the priest
to come. Living or dead I would wish to do
all that is rightful for the last and the best of
my own race and generation.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY [<i>jumping up</i>].</div>

<p>Is it the priest you are bringing in among us?
Where is the sense in that? Aren’t we robbed
enough up to this with the expense of the
candles and the like?</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>If it is that poor starved priest he called to
that came talking in secret signs to the man
that is gone, it is likely he will ask nothing for
what he has to do. There is many a priest is
a Whiteboy in his heart.</p>

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>I tell you, if you brought him tied in a bag
he would not say an Our Father for you, without
you having a half-crown at the top of your
fingers.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>There is no priest is any good at all but a
spoiled priest. A one that would take a drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of drink, it is he would have courage to face
the hosts of trouble. Rout them out he would,
the same as a shoal of fish from out the weeds.
It’s best not to vex a priest, or to run against
them at all.</p>

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>It’s yourself humbled yourself well to one the
time you were sick in the gaol and had like to
die, and he bade you to give over the throwing
of the cups.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>Ah, plaster of Paris I gave him. I took to
it again and I free upon the roads.</p>

<div class="speakerc">NANNY.</div>

<p>Much good you are doing with it to yourself
or any other one. Aren’t you after telling that
corpse no later than yesterday that he was coming
within the best day of his life?</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>Whisht, let ye. Here is the priest coming.</p>

<div class="enter"><i><span class="small">FATHER JOHN</span> comes in.</i></div>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>It is surely not true that he is dead?</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>The spirit went from him about the middle
hour of the night. We brought him here to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
this sheltered place. We were loth to leave him
without friends.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Where is he?</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY [<i>taking up sacks</i>].</div>

<p>Lying there stiff and stark. He has a very
quiet look as if there was no sin at all or no
great trouble upon his mind.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN [<i>kneels and touches him</i>].</div>

<p>He is not dead.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY [<i>pointing to <span class="small">NANNY</span></i>].</div>

<p>He is dead. If it was letting on he was, he
would not have let that one rob him and search
him the way she did.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>It has the appearance of death, but it is not
death. He is in a trance.</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>Is it Heaven and Hell he is walking at this
time to be bringing back newses of the sinners
in pain?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>I was thinking myself it might away he was,
riding on white horses with the riders of the
forths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>He will have great wonders to tell out the
time he will rise up from the ground. It is a
pity he not to waken at this time and to lead
us on to overcome the troop of the English.
Sure those that are in a trance get strength, that
they can walk on water.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>It was Father John wakened him yesterday
the time he was lying in the same way. Wasn’t
I telling you it was for that I called to him?</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>Waken him now till they’ll see did I tell
any lie in my foretelling. I knew well by the
signs, he was coming within the best day of his
life.</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>And not dead at all! We’ll be marching to
attack Dublin itself within a week. The horn
will blow for him, and all good men will gather
to him. Hurry on, Father, and waken him.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I will not waken him. I will not bring him
back from where he is.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>And how long will it be before he will waken
of himself?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Maybe to-day, maybe to-morrow, it is hard
to be certain.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>If it is <i>away</i> he is he might be away seven
years. To be lying like a stump of a tree and
using no food and the world not able to knock
a word out of him, I know the signs of it well.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>We cannot be waiting and watching through
seven years. If the business he has started is to
be done we have to go on here and now. The
time there is any delay, that is the time the
Government will get information. Waken him
now, Father, and you’ll get the blessing of the
generations.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I will not bring him back. God will bring
him back in his own good time. For all I know
he may be seeing the hidden things of God.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>He might slip away in his dream. It is best
to raise him up now.</p>

<div class="speakerc">ANDREW.</div>

<p>Waken him, Father John. I thought he was
surely dead this time, and what way could I go
face Thomas through all that is left of my lifetime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
after me standing up to face him the way
I did? And if I do take a little drop of an odd
night, sure I’d be very lonesome if I did not
take it. All the world knows it’s not for love
of what I drink, but for love of the people that
do be with me! Waken him, Father, or maybe
I would waken him myself. [<i>Shakes him.</i>]</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Lift your hand from touching him. Leave
him to himself and to the power of God.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>If you will not bring him back why wouldn’t
we ourselves do it? Go on now, it is best for
you to do it yourself.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>I woke him yesterday. He was angry with
me, he could not get to the heart of the command.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>If he did not, he got a command from myself
that satisfied him, and a message.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>He did—he took it from you—and how do
I know what devil’s message it may have been
that brought him into that devil’s work, destruction
and drunkenness and burnings! That
was not a message from heaven! It was I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
awoke him, it was I kept him from hearing
what was maybe a divine message, a voice of
truth, and he heard you speak and he believed
the message was brought by you. You have
made use of your deceit and his mistaking—you
have left him without house or means to
support him, you are striving to destroy and to
drag him to entire ruin. I will not help you,
I would rather see him die in his trance and
go into God’s hands than awake him and see
him go into hell’s mouth with vagabonds and
outcasts like you!</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY [<i>turning to <span class="small">BIDDY</span></i>].</div>

<p>You should have knowledge, Biddy Lally, of
the means to bring back a man that is away.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>The power of the earth will do it through
its herbs, and the power of the air will do it
kindling fire into flame.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>Rise up and make no delay. Stretch out and
gather a handful of an herb that will bring him
back from whatever place he is in.</p>

<div class="speakerc">BIDDY.</div>

<p>That music, I must go nearer—sweet marvellous

the unicorns; far louder, though the mountain
is shaking with their feet—high joyous music.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>Hush, he is listening to the music of Heaven!</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Take me to you, musicians, wherever you
are! I will go nearer to you; I hear you better
now, more and more joyful; that is strange, it
is strange.</p>

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>He is getting some secret.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>It is the music of Paradise, that is certain,
somebody said that. It is certainly the music
of Paradise. Ah, now I hear, now I understand.
It is made of the continual clashing of swords!</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>That is the best music. We will clash them
sure enough. We will clash our swords and our
pikes on the bayonets of the red soldiers. It
is well you rose up from the dead to lead us!
Come on, now, come on!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Who are you? Ah, I remember—where are
you asking me to come to?</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>To come on, to be sure, to the attack on the
barracks at Aughanish. To carry on the work
you took in hand last night.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>What work did I take in hand last night?
Oh, yes, I remember—some big house—we
burned it down—but I had not understood the
vision when I did that. I had not heard the
command right. That was not the work I was
sent to do.</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>Rise up now and bid us what to do. Your
great name itself will clear the road before you.
It is you yourself will have freed all Ireland
before the stooks will be in stacks!</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Listen, I will explain—I have misled you.
It is only now I have the whole vision plain.
As I lay there I saw through everything, I know
all. It was but a frenzy that going out to burn
and to destroy. What have I to do with the
foreign army? What I have to pierce is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
wild heart of time. My business is not reformation
but revelation.</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>If you are going to turn back now from leading
us, you are no better than any other traitor
that ever gave up the work he took in hand.
Let you come and face now the two hundred
men you brought out daring the power of the
law last night, and give them your reason for
failing them.</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>I was mistaken when I set out to destroy
Church and Law. The battle we have to fight
is fought out in our own mind. There is a fiery
moment, perhaps once in a lifetime, and in that
moment we see the only thing that matters.
It is in that moment the great battles are lost
and won, for in that moment we are a part of
the host of heaven.</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>Have you betrayed us to the naked hangman
with your promises and with your drink? If
you brought us out here to fail us and to ridicule
us, it is the last day you will live!</p>

<div class="speakerc">JOHNNY.</div>

<p>The curse of my heart on you! It would be
right to send you to your own place on the flagstone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the traitors in hell. When once I have
made an end of you I will be as well satisfied
to be going to my death for it as if I was going
home!</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>Father John, Father John, can you not hear?

<div class="speakerc">FATHER JOHN.</div>

<p>What is it? What is it?</p>

<div class="speakerc">MARTIN.</div>

<p>There on the mountain, a thousand white
unicorns trampling; a thousand riders with
their swords drawn—the swords clashing! Oh,
the sound of the swords, the sound of the clashing
of the swords!</p>

all things, or of the Plough that was hidden in
the old times, the Golden Plough.</p>

<div class="speakerc">PAUDEEN.</div>

<p>Father John, Heaven is not what we have

and making music, and all strife at an end.
I have seen it, I have been there. The lover
still loves but with a greater passion, and the
rider still rides but the horse goes like the wind
and leaps the ridges, and the battle goes on
always, always. That is the joy of Heaven, continual
battle. I thought the battle was here,
and that the joy was to be found here on earth,
that all one had to do was to bring again the
old wild earth of the stories—but no, it is not
here; we shall not come to that joy, that battle,
till we have put out the senses, everything that
can be seen and handled, as I put out this candle.
[<i>He puts out candle.</i>] We must put out the whole
world as I put out this candle [<i>puts out another

<h3><i>THE COUNTESS CATHLEEN.</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Preface to the Fourth Edition.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present version of <i>The Countess Cathleen</i> is not quite
the version adopted by the Irish Literary Theatre a couple
of years ago, for our stage and scenery were capable of little;
and it may differ still more from any stage version I make
in future, for it seems that my people of the waters and my
unhappy dead, in the third act, cannot keep their supernatural
essence, but must put on too much of our mortality,
in any ordinary theatre. I am told that I must abandon a
meaning or two and make my merchants carry away the
treasure themselves. The act was written long ago, when I
had seen so few plays that I took pleasure in stage effects.
Indeed, I am not yet certain that a wealthy theatre could not
shape it to an impressive pageantry, or that a theatre without
any wealth could not lift it out of pageantry into the mind,
with a dim curtain, and some dimly robed actors, and the
beautiful voices that should be as important in poetical as in
musical drama. The Elizabethan stage was so little imprisoned
in material circumstance that the Elizabethan imagination
was not strained by god or spirit, nor even by Echo
herself—no, not even when she answered, as in <i>The Duchess
of Malfi</i>, in clear, loud words which were not the words
that had been spoken to her. We have made a prison-house
of paint and canvas, where we have as little freedom as
under our own roofs, for there is no freedom in a house that
has been made with hands. All art moves in the cave of the
Chimæra, or in the garden of the Hesperides, or in the more
silent house of the gods, and neither cave, nor garden, nor
house can show itself clearly but to the mind’s eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides re-writing a lyric or two, I have much enlarged
the note on <i>The Countess Cathleen</i>, as there has been some
discussion in Ireland about the origin of the story, but the
other notes<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> are as they have always been. They are short
enough, but I do not think that anybody who knows modern
poetry will find obscurities in this book. In any case, I must
leave my myths and symbols to explain themselves as the
years go by and one poem lights up another, and the stories
that friends, and one friend in particular, have gathered for
me, or that I have gathered myself in many cottages, find
their way into the light. I would, if I could, add to that
great and complicated inheritance of images which written
literature has substituted for the greater and more complex
inheritance of spoken tradition, to that majestic heraldry of
the poets some new heraldic images gathered from the lips
of the common people. Christianity and the old nature
faith have lain down side by side in the cottages, and I
would proclaim that peace as loudly as I can among the
kingdoms of poetry, where there is no peace that is not
joyous, no battle that does not give life instead of death;
I may even try to persuade others, in more sober prose, that
there can be no language more worthy of poetry and of the
meditation of the soul than that which has been made, or can
be made, out of a subtlety of desire, an emotion of sacrifice,
a delight in order, that are perhaps Christian, and myths
and images that mirror the energies of woods and streams,
and of their wild creatures. Has any part of that majestic
heraldry of the poets had a very different fountain? Is it
not the ritual of the marriage of heaven and earth?</p>

<p>These details may seem to many unnecessary; but after
all one writes poetry for a few careful readers and for a few
friends, who will not consider such details very unnecessary.
When Cimabue had the cry it was, it seems, worth thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of those that run; but to-day, when they can write as well
as read, one can sit with one’s companions under the hedgerow
contentedly. If one writes well and has the patience,
somebody will come from among the runners and read what
one has written quickly, and go away quickly, and write out
as much as he can remember in the language of the highway.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<p><i>The Countess Cathleen.</i>—I found the story of the Countess
Cathleen in what professed to be a collection of Irish folklore
in an Irish newspaper some years ago. I wrote to the
compiler, asking about its source, but got no answer, but
have since heard that it was translated from <i>Les Matinées de
Timothé Trimm</i> a good many years ago, and has been drifting
about the Irish press ever since. Léo Lespès gives it as an
Irish story, and though the editor of <i>Folklore</i> has kindly
advertised for information, the only Christian variant I know
of is a Donegal tale, given by Mr. Larminie in his <i>West
Irish Folk Tales and Romances</i>, of a woman who goes to hell
for ten years to save her husband and stays there another
ten, having been granted permission to carry away as many
souls as could cling to her skirt. Léo Lespès may have
added a few details, but I have no doubt of the essential
antiquity of what seems to me the most impressive form of
one of the supreme parables of the world. The parable came
to the Greeks in the sacrifice of Alcestis, but her sacrifice
was less overwhelming, less apparently irremediable. Léo
Lespès tells the story as follows:—</p>

<p>‘Ce que je vais vous dire est un récit du carême Irlandais.
Le boiteux, l’aveugle, le paralytique des rues de Dublin ou
de Limerick, vous le diraient mieux que moi, cher lecteur,
si vous alliez le leur demander, un sixpence d’argent à la
main.—Il n’est pas une jeune fille catholique à laquelle on ne
l’ait appris, pendant les jours de préparation à la communion
sainte, pas un berger des bords de la Blackwater qui ne le
puisse redire à la veillée.</p>

<p>‘Il y a bien longtemps qu’il apparut tout-à-coup dans la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
vieille Irlande deux marchands inconnus dont personne
n’avait ouï parler, et qui parlaient néanmoins avec la plus
grande perfection la langue du pays. Leurs cheveux étaient
noirs et ferrés avec de l’or et leurs robes d’une grande
magnificence.</p>

<p>Tous deux semblaient avoir le même âge: ils paraissaient
être des hommes de cinquante ans, car leur barbe grisonnait
un peu.</p>

<p>Or, à cette époque, comme aujourd’hui, l’Irlande était
pauvre, car le soleil avait été rare, et des récoltes presque
nulles. Les indigents ne savaient à quel saint se vouer, et la
misère devenait de plus en plus terrible.</p>

<p>Dans l’hôtellerie où descendirent les marchands fastueux
on chercha à pénétrer leurs desseins: mais ce fut en vain, ils
demeurèrent silencieux et discrets.</p>

<p>Et pendant qu’ils demeurèrent dans l’hôtellerie, ils ne cessèrent
de compter et de recompter des sacs de pièces d’or, dont
la vive clarté s’apercevait à travers les vitres du logis.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, leur dit l’hôtesse un jour, d’où vient que vous
êtes si opulents, et que, venus pour secourir la misère publique,
vous ne fassiez pas de bonnes œuvres?</p>

<p>—Belle hôtesse, répondit l’un d’eux, nous n’avons pas
voulu aller au-devant d’infortunes honorables, dans la crainte
d’être trompés par des misères fictives: que la douleur frappe
à la porte, nous ouvrirons.</p>

<p>Le lendemain, quand on sut qu’il existait deux opulents
étrangers prêts à prodiguer l’or, la foule assiégea leur logis;
mais les figures des gens qui en sortaient étaient bien diverses.
Les uns avaient la fierté dans le regard, les autres portaient
la honte au front. Les deux trafiquants achetaient des âmes
pour le démon. L’âme d’un vieillard valait vingt pièces d’or,
pas un penny de plus; car Satan avait eu le temps d’y former
hypothèque. L’âme d’une épouse en valait cinquante quand
elle était jolie, ou cent quand elle était laide. L’âme d’une
jeune fille se payait des prix fous: les fleurs les plus belles et
les plus pures sont les plus chères.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Pendant ce temps, il existait dans la ville un ange de
beauté, la comtesse Ketty O’Donnor. Elle était l’idole du
peuple, et la providence des indigents. Dès qu’elle eut appris
que des mécréants profitaient de la misère publique pour
dérober des cœurs à Dieu, elle fit appeler son majordome.</p>

<p>—Master Patrick, lui dit elle, combien ai-je de pièces
d’or dans mon coffre?</p>

<p>—Cent mille.</p>

<p>—Combien de bijoux?</p>

<p>—Pour autant d’argent.</p>

<p>—Combien de châteaux, de bois et de terres?</p>

<p>—Pour le double de ces sommes.</p>

<p>—Eh bien! Patrick, vendez tout ce qui n’est pas or et
apportez-m’en le montant. Je ne veux garder à moi que ce
castel et le champ qui l’entoure.</p>

<p>Deux jours après, les ordres de la pieuse Ketty étaient
exécutés et le trésor était distribué aux pauvres au fur et à
mesure de leurs besoins.</p>

<p>Ceci ne faisait pas le compte, dit la tradition, des commis-voyageurs
du malin esprit, qui ne trouvaient plus d’âmes à
acheter.</p>

<p>Aidés par un valet infâme, ils pénétrèrent dans la retraite
de la noble dame et lui dérobèrent le reste de son trésor .&nbsp;.
en vain lutta-t-elle de toutes ses forces pour sauver le contenu
de son coffre, les larrons diaboliques furent les plus
forts. Si Ketty avait eu les moyens de faire un signe de
croix, ajoute la légende Irlandaise, elle les eût mis en fuite,
mais ses mains étaient captives—Le larcin fut effectué. Alors
les pauvres sollicitèrent en vain près de Ketty dépouillée, elle
ne pouvait plus secourir leur misère;—elle les abandonnait
à la tentation. Pourtant il n’y avait plus que huit jours à
passer pour que les grains et les fourrages arrivassent en
abondance des pays d’Orient. Mais, huit jours, c’était un
siècle: huit jours nécessitaient une somme immense pour
subvenir aux exigences de la disette, et les pauvres allaient
ou expirer dans les angoisses de la faim, ou, reniant les saintes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
maximes de l’Evangile, vendre à vil prix leur âme, le plus
beau présent de la munificence du Seigneur tout-puissant.</p>

<p>Et Ketty n’avait plus une obole, car elle avait abandonné
son château aux malheureux.</p>

<p>Elle passa douze heures dans les larmes et le deuil, arrachant
ses cheveux couleur de soleil et meurtrissant son sein couleur
du lis: puis elle se leva résolue, animée par un vif sentiment
de désespoir.</p>

<p>Elle se rendit chez les marchands d’âmes.</p>

<p>—Que voulez-vous? dirent ils.</p>

<p>—Vous achetez des âmes?</p>

<p>—Oui, un peu malgré vous, n’est ce pas, sainte aux yeux
de saphir?</p>

<p>—Aujourd’hui je viens vous proposer un marché, reprit
elle.</p>

<p>—Lequel?</p>

<p>—J’ai une âme a vendre; mais elle est chère.</p>

<p>—Qu’importe si elle est précieuse? l’âme, comme le diamant,
s’apprécie à sa blancheur.</p>

<p>—C’est la mienne, dit Ketty.</p>

<p>Les deux envoyés de Satan tressaillirent. Leurs griffes
s’allongèrent sous leurs gants de cuir; leurs yeux gris étincelèrent:—l’âme,
pure, immaculée, virginale de Ketty!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
c’était une acquisition inappréciable.</p>

<p>—Gentille dame, combien voulez-vous?</p>

<p>—Cent cinquante mille écus d’or.</p>

<p>—C’est fait, dirent les marchands; et ils tendirent à
Ketty un parchemin cacheté de noir, qu’elle signa en
frissonnant.</p>

<p>La somme lui fut comptée.</p>

<p>Dès qu’elle fut rentrée, elle dit au majordome:</p>

<p>—Tenez, distribuez ceci. Avec la somme que je vous
donne les pauvres attendront la huitaine nécessaire et pas une
de leurs âmes ne sera livrée au démon.</p>

<p>Puis elle s’enferma et recommanda qu’on ne vint pas la
déranger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Trois jours se passèrent; elle n’appela pas; elle ne sortit
pas.</p>

<p>Quand on ouvrit sa porte, on la trouva raide et froide: elle
était morte de douleur.</p>

<p>Mais la vente de cette âme si adorable dans sa charité fut
déclarée nulle par le Seigneur: car elle avait sauvé ses
concitoyens de la mort éternelle.</p>

<p>Après la huitaine, des vaisseaux nombreux amenèrent à
l’Irlande affamée d’immenses provisions de grains.</p>

<p>La famine n’était plus possible. Quant aux marchands,
ils disparurent de leur hôtellerie, sans qu’on sût jamais ce
qu’ils étaient devenus.</p>

<p>Toutefois, les pêcheurs de la Blackwater prétendent qu’ils
sont enchaînés dans une prison souterraine par ordre de
Lucifer jusqu’au moment où ils pourront livrer l’âme de
Ketty qui leur a échappé. Je vous dis la légende telle que je
la sais.</p>

<p>—Mais les pauvres l’ont raconté d’âge en âge et les
enfants de Cork et de Dublin chantent encore la ballade dont
voici les derniers couplets:—</p>

<p>N’est ce pas que ce récit, né de l’imagination des poètes
catholiques de la verte Erin, est une véritable récit de carême?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Countess Cathleen</i> was acted in Dublin in 1899
with Mr. Marcus St. John and Mr. Trevor Lowe as the
First and Second Demon, Mr. Valentine Grace as Shemus
Rua, Master Charles Sefton as Teig, Madame San Carola as
Maire, Miss Florence Farr as Aleel, Miss Anna Mather as
Oona, Mr. Charles Holmes as the Herdsman, Mr. Jack
Wilcox as the Gardener, Mr. Walford as a Peasant, Miss
Dorothy Paget as a Spirit, Miss M. Kelly as a Peasant
Woman, Mr. T. E. Wilkenson as a Servant, and Miss May
Whitty as the Countess Cathleen. They had to face a
very vehement opposition stirred up by a politician and a
newspaper, the one accusing me in a pamphlet, the other in
long articles day after day, of blasphemy because of the
language of the demons in the first act, and because I made
a woman sell her soul and yet escape damnation, and of a
lack of patriotism because I made Irish men and women,
who it seems never did such a thing, sell theirs. The
politician or the newspaper persuaded some forty Catholic
students to sign a protest against the play, and a Cardinal,
who avowed that he had not read it, to make another, and
both politician and newspaper made such obvious appeals to
the audience to break the peace, that some score of police<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
were sent to the theatre to see that they did not. I have,
however, no reason to regret the result, for the stalls, containing
almost all that was distinguished in Dublin, and a
gallery of artisans, alike insisted on the freedom of literature,
and I myself have the pleasure of recording strange events.</p>

<p>The play has since been revived in New York by Miss
Wycherley, but I did not see her performance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Land of Heart’s Desire.</i>—This little play was produced
at the Avenue Theatre in the spring of 1894, with
the following cast:—Maurteen Bruin, Mr. James Welch;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Shawn Bruin, Mr. A. E. W. Mason; Father Hart, Mr. G.
R. Foss; Bridget Bruin, Miss Charlotte Morland; Maire
Bruin, Miss Winifred Fraser; A Faery Child, Miss Dorothy
Paget. It ran for a little over six weeks. It was revived in
America in 1901, when it was taken on tour by Mrs.
Lemoyne. It was again played, under the auspices of the
Irish Literary Society of New York, in 1903, and has lately
been played in San Francisco.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The Unicorn from the Stars.</i>—Some years ago I wrote in a
fortnight with the help of Lady Gregory and another friend
a five act tragedy called <i>Where there is Nothing</i>. I wrote at
such speed that I might save from a plagiarist a subject that
seemed worth the keeping till greater knowledge of the stage
made an adequate treatment possible. I knew that my first
version was hurried and oratorical, with events cast into the
plot because they seemed lively or amusing in themselves,
and not because they grew out of the characters and the
plot; and I came to dislike a central character so arid and so
dominating. We cannot sympathise with a man who sets
his anger at once lightly and confidently to overthrow the
order of the world; but our hearts can go out to him, as
I think, if he speak with some humility, so far as his daily
self carries him, out of a cloudy light of vision. Whether
he understand or know, it may be that the voices of Angels
and Archangels have spoken in the cloud and whatever wildness
come upon his life, feet of theirs may well have trod
the clusters. I began with this new thought to dictate the
play to Lady Gregory, but since I had last worked with
her, her knowledge of the stage and her mastery of dialogue
had so increased that my imagination could not go neck to
neck with hers. I found myself, too, with an old difficulty,
that my words flow freely alone when my people speak in
verse, or in words that are like those we put into verse; and
so after an attempt to work alone I gave my scheme to her.
The result is a play almost wholly hers in handiwork, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
I can yet read, as I have just done after the stories of <i>The
Secret Rose</i>, and recognize thoughts, a point of view, an
artistic aim which seem a part of my world. Her greatest
difficulty was that I had given her for chief character a man
so plunged in trance that he could not be otherwise than all
but still and silent, though perhaps with the stillness and the
silence of a lamp; and the movement of the play as a whole,
if we were to listen to hear him, had to be without hurry or
violence. The strange characters, her handiwork, on whom he
sheds his light, delight me. She has enabled me to carry out
an old thought for which my own knowledge is insufficient
and to commingle the ancient phantasies of poetry with
the rough, vivid, ever-contemporaneous tumult of the road-side;
to create for a moment a form that otherwise I could
but dream of, though I do that always, an art that prophesies
though with worn and failing voice of the day when Quixote
and Sancho Panza long estranged may once again go out
gaily into the bleak air. Ever since I began to write I have
awaited with impatience a linking, all Europe over, of the
hereditary knowledge of the country-side, now becoming
known to us through the work of wanderers and men of
learning, with our old lyricism so full of ancient frenzies and
hereditary wisdom, a yoking of antiquities, a Marriage of
Heaven and Hell.</p>

<p><i>The Unicorn from the Stars</i> was first played at the Abbey
Theatre on November 23rd, 1907, with the following
cast:—Father John, Ernest Vaughan; Thomas Hearne, a
coachbuilder, Arthur Sinclair; Andrew Hearne, brother of
Thomas, J. A. O’Rourke; Martin Hearne, nephew of
Thomas, F. J. Fay; Johnny Bacach, a beggar, W. G. Fay;
Paudeen, J. M. Kerrigan; Biddy Lally, Maire O’Neill;
Nanny, Brigit O’Dempsey.</p>

<h2>THE MUSIC FOR USE IN THE PERFORMANCE
OF THESE PLAYS.</h2>


<p>All the music that is printed here, with the exception of
Mr. Arthur Darley’s, is of that kind which I have described
in <i>Samhain</i> and in <i>Ideas of Good and Evil</i>. Some of it is old
Irish music made when all songs were but heightened speech,
and some of it composed by modern musicians is none the
less to be associated with words that must never lose the
intonation of passionate speech. No vowel must ever be prolonged
unnaturally, no word of mine must ever change into
a mere musical note, no singer of my words must ever cease
to be a man and become an instrument.</p>

<p>The degree of approach to ordinary singing depends on
the context, for one desires a greater or lesser amount of
contrast between the lyrics and the dialogue according to
situation and emotion and the qualities of players. The words
of Cathleen ni Houlihan about the ‘white-scarfed riders’
must be little more than regulated declamation; the little
song of Leagerie when he seizes the ‘Golden Helmet’ should
in its opening words be indistinguishable from the dialogue
itself. Upon the other hand, Cathleen’s verses by the fire,
and those of the pupils in the <i>Hour-Glass</i>, and those of the
beggars in the <i>Unicorn</i>, are sung as the country people understand
song. Modern singing would spoil them for dramatic
purposes by taking the keenness and the salt out of the words.
The songs in <i>Deirdre</i>, in Miss Farr’s and in Miss Allgood’s
setting, need fine speakers of verse more than good singers;
and in these, and still more in the song of the Three Women
in <i>Baile’s Strand</i>, the singers must remember the natural
speed of words. If the lyric in <i>Baile’s Strand</i> is sung slowly
it is like church-singing, but if sung quickly and with
the right expression it becomes an incantation so old that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
nobody can quite understand it. That it may give this sense
of something half-forgotten, it must be sung with a certain
lack of minute feeling for the meaning of the words, which,
however, must always remain words. The songs in <i>Deirdre</i>,
especially the last dirge, which is supposed to be the creation
of the moment, must, upon the other hand, at any rate
when Miss Farr’s or Miss Allgood’s music is used, be sung or
spoken with minute passionate understanding. I have rehearsed
the part of the Angel in the <i>Hour-Glass</i> with recorded
notes throughout, and believe this is the right way; but in
practice, owing to the difficulty of finding a player who did
not sing too much the moment the notes were written
down, have left it to the player’s own unrecorded inspiration,
except at the ‘exit,’ where it is well for the player
to go nearer to ordinary song.</p>

<p>I have not yet put Miss Farr’s <i>Deirdre</i> music to the test
of performances, but, as she and I have worked out all this
art of spoken song together, I have little doubt but I shall
find it all I would have it. Mr. Darley’s music was used at
the first production of the play and at its revival last spring,
and was dramatically effective. I could hear the words perfectly,
and I think they must have been audible to anyone
hearing the play for the first or second time. They had not,
however, the full animation of speech, as one heard it in the
dirge at the end of the play set by Miss Allgood herself, who
played the principal musician. It is very difficult for a
musician who is not a speaker to do exactly what I want.
Mr. Darley has written for singers not for speakers. His
music is, perhaps, too elaborate, simple though it is. I have
not had sufficient opportunity to experiment with the play
to find out the exact distance from ordinary speech necessary
in the first two lyrics, which must prolong the mood of the
dialogue while being a rest from its passions. Miss Farr’s
music will be used at the next revival of the play.</p>

<p>Mr. Darley’s music for <i>Shadowy Waters</i> was supposed to
be played upon Forgael’s magic harp, and it accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
words of Dectora’s and Aibric’s. It was played in reality
upon a violin, always pizzicato, and gave the effect of harp
playing, at any rate of a magic harp. The ‘cues’ are all
given and the words are printed under the music. The
violinist followed the voice, except in the case of the ‘O’,
where it was the actress that had to follow.</p>

<h2>MUSIC FOR LYRICS.</h2>


<p>Three of the following settings are by Miss Farr, and she
accompanies the words upon her psaltery for the most part.
She has a beautiful speaking-voice, and, an almost rarer thing,
a perfect ear for verse; and nothing but the attempting of
it will show how far these things can be taught or developed
where they exist but a little. I believe that they should be
a part of the teaching of all children, for the beauty of the
speaking-voice is more important to our lives than that of
the singing, and the rhythm of words comes more into the
structure of our daily being than any abstract pattern of notes.
The relation between formal music and speech will yet
become the subject of science, not less than the occasion of
artistic discovery; for I am certain that all poets, even all
delighted readers of poetry, speak certain kinds of poetry to
distinct and simple tunes, though the speakers may be,
perhaps generally are, deaf to ordinary music, even what
we call tone-deaf. I suggest that we will discover in this
relation a very early stage in the development of music, with
its own great beauty, and that those who love lyric poetry
but cannot tell one tune from another repeat a state of mind
which created music and yet was incapable of the emotional
abstraction which delights in patterns of sound separated from
words. To it the music was an unconscious creation, the
words a conscious, for no beginnings are in the intellect, and
no living thing remembers its own birth.</p>

<p>I give after Miss Farr’s settings three others, two taken
down by Mr. Arnold Dolmetsch from myself, and one from
a fine scholar in poetry, who hates all music but that of
poetry, and knows of no instrument that does not fill him
with rage and misery. Mr. Arnold Dolmetsch, when he
took up the subject at my persuasion, wrote down the
recitation of another lyric poet, who like myself knows nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of music, and found little tunes that delighted him;
and Mr. George Russell (‘A.E.’) writes all his lyrics, a musician
tells me, to two little tunes which sound like old
Arabic music. I do not mean that there is only one way
of reciting a poem that is correct, for different tunes will
fit different speakers or different moods of the same speaker,
but as a rule the more the music of the verse becomes a
movement of the stanza as a whole, at the same time detaching
itself from the sense as in much of Mr. Swinburne’s
poetry, the less does the poet vary in his recitation. I mean
in the way he recites when alone, or unconscious of an
audience, for before an audience he will remember the imperfection
of his ear in note and tone, and cling to daily speech,
or something like it.</p>

<p>Sometimes one composes to a remembered air. I wrote
and I still speak the verses that begin ‘Autumn is over the
long leaves that love us’ to some traditional air, though I
could not tell that air or any other on another’s lips, and
<i>The Ballad of Father Gilligan</i> to a modification of the air
<i>A Fine Old English Gentleman</i>. When, however, the rhythm
is more personal than it is in these simple verses, the tune
will always be original and personal, alike in the poet and
in the reader who has the right ear; and these tunes will
now and again have great beauty.</p>


<h3>NOTE BY FLORENCE FARR.</h3>

<p>I made an interesting discovery after I had been elaborating
the art of speaking to the psaltery for some time. I had tried
to make it more beautiful than the speaking by priests at
High Mass, the singing of recitative in opera and the speaking
through music of actors in melodrama. My discovery
was that those who had invented these arts had all said about
them exactly what Mr. Arnold Dolmetsch and Mr. W. B.
Yeats said about my art. Anyone can prove this for himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
who will go to a library and read the authorities that describe
how early liturgical chant, plain-song and jubilations
or melismata were adapted from the ancient traditional music;
or if they read the history of the beginning of opera and the
‘nuove musiche’ by Caccini, or study the music of Monteverde
and Carissimi, who flourished at the beginning of the
seventeenth century, they will find these masters speak of
doing all they can to give an added beauty to the words of
the poet, often using simple vowel sounds when a purely
vocal effect was to be made whether of joy or sorrow. There
is no more beautiful sound than the alternation of carolling
or keening and a voice speaking in regulated declamation.
The very act of alternation has a peculiar charm.</p>

<p>Now to read these records of music of the eighth and
seventeenth centuries one would think that the Church and
the opera were united in the desire to make beautiful speech
more beautiful, but I need not say if we put such a hope to
the test we discover it is groundless. There is no ecstasy in
the delivery of ritual, and recitative is certainly not treated by
opera-singers in a way that makes us wish to imitate them.</p>

<p>When beginners attempt to speak to musical notes they
fall naturally into the intoning as heard throughout our lands
in our various religious rituals. It is not until they have been
forced to use their imaginations and express the inmost
meaning of the words, not until their thought imposes itself
upon all listeners and each word invokes a special mode of
beauty, that the method rises once more from the dead and
becomes a living art.</p>

<p>It is the belief in the power of words and the delight in
the purity of sound that will make the arts of plain-chant
and recitative the great arts they are described as being by
those who first practised them.</p>

<b>Music Transcriber’s Notes:</b></div>

<p>Rhythms have been added to all songs where words are to be spoken on a
single note, to match the rhythm of speech.</p>

<p>Shadowy Waters—Although Yeats states in his notes on the music (pp.
223-24) that this piece was played on a violin in actual performance,
he states that it is meant to be “Forgael’s magic harp.” For that
reason, and reasons of improved sound in midi, a harp sound has been
used.</p>

<p>The Airy Bachelor—in bar 3, the second and fourth quarter notes have
been corrected to eighths. In “Johnnie Gibbons,” bar 1, the first note
should be a dotted quarter. In “The Lion shall lose his strength,” bar
3, the first note should be a dotted quarter.</p>

<p>I—The rests should be quarter rests. II and III—The key and time
signature are missing in the original, so the transcriber has guessed
at them and adjusted the rhythm to the words.</p>

<p>The Song of Wandering Aengus—a sixteenth rest and fermata have been
added to bar 7 to match the rhythm of the other lines in the song.</p>

<p>The Song of the Old Mother—In bars 3 and 19, the first note should be
sharp. In the line “And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress,” the
eighth note for “but” should be in the next bar.</p>
